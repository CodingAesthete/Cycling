          <h1>Giro d'Italia</h1>

          <p>The Giro d'Italia is an annual multiple-stage bicycle race primarily held in Italy, while also starting in,
            or passing through, other countries. The first race was organized in 1909 to increase sales of the newspaper
            La Gazzetta dello Sport, and the race is still run by a subsidiary of that paper's owner. The race has been
            held annually since its first edition in 1909, except during the two world wars. As the Giro gained
            prominence and popularity the race was lengthened, and the peloton expanded from primarily Italian
            participation to riders from all over the world. The Giro is usually held during May, sometimes continuing
            into early June. While the route changes each year, the format of the race stays the same, with at least two
            time trials, and a passage through the mountains of the Alps, including the Dolomites.A few riders from each
            team aim to win overall but there are three further competitions to draw riders of all specialties: points,
            mountains, and a classification for young riders with general classification aspirations.</p>

          <h1>Tour de France</h1>

          <p>The Tour de France is an annual men's multiple-stage bicycle race primarily held in France. It consists of
            21 stages, each a day long, over the course of 23 days, coinciding with the Bastille Day holiday. It is the
            oldest of the Grand Tours and generally considered the most prestigious. The race was first organized in
            1903 to increase sales for the newspaper L'Auto and is currently run by the Amaury Sport Organisation. The
            race has been held annually since its first edition in 1903 except when it was stopped for the two World
            Wars. As the Tour gained prominence and popularity, the race was lengthened and its reach began to extend
            around the globe. Participation expanded from a primarily French field as more riders from all over the
            world began to participate in the race each year. Since 1975 the finish has been on the Champs-Élysées in
            Paris; from 1903 to 1967 the race finished at the Parc des Princes stadium in western Paris and from 1968 to
            1974 at the Piste Municipale south of the capital.</p>

          <h1>Vuelta a España</h1>

          <p>The Vuelta a España is an annual multi-stage bicycle race primarily held in Spain. Inspired by the success
            of the Tour de France and the Giro d'Italia, the race was first organised in 1935. The race was prevented
            from being run by the Spanish Civil War and World War II in the early years of its existence; however, the
            race has been held annually since 1955. As the Vuelta gained prestige and popularity the race was lengthened
            and its reach began to extend all around the globe. Since 1979, the event has been staged and managed by
            Unipublic, until in 2014, when the Amaury Sport Organisation acquired control. Since then, they have been
            working together. The Vuelta is a UCI World Tour event, which means that the teams that compete in the race
            are mostly UCI WorldTeams, with the exception of the wild card teams. All of the stages are timed to the
            finish; after finishing, the riders' times are compounded with their previous stage times. The rider with
            the lowest aggregate time is the leader of the race and gets to don the red jersey.</p>
